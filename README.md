## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of agricultural data to identify trends and patterns that can help in optimizing crop yield and resource management. The analysis includes various environmental factors such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity, and their impact on crop yield.

## Data Source

The data used for this analysis was sourced from historical agricultural records and uploaded to AWS. The data includes:
- Year
- Location
- Area
- Rainfall
- Temperature
- Self type
- Irrigation
- Yields
- Humidity
- Crop
- Price
- Season

## Tools and Technologies

- **AWS**: Data storage and preprocessing
- **Snowflake**: Data warehousing
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **GitHub**: Version control and repository management

## Dashboards

### Rainfall Analysis Dashboard

- **Purpose**: Analyze the impact of rainfall on crop yield.
- **Key Visuals**:
  - Rainfall trends over time
  - Correlation between rainfall and yield
  - Regional rainfall patterns

### Temperature Analysis Dashboard

- **Purpose**: Examine the effect of temperature on crop yield.
- **Key Visuals**:
  - Temperature trends over time
  - Correlation between temperature and yield
  - Optimal temperature ranges for different crops

### Humidity Analysis Dashboard

- **Purpose**: Investigate the relationship between humidity and crop yield.
- **Key Visuals**:
  - Humidity trends over time
  - Correlation between humidity and yield
  - Optimal humidity ranges for different crops

### Yield Analysis Dashboard

- **Purpose**: Analyze and predict crop yield based on various factors.
- **Key Visuals**:
  - Yield trends over time
  - Factors affecting yield (rainfall, temperature, humidity)
  - Predictive models for yield estimation
